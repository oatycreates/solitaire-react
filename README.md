The React component of this project was created using a base of Facebook's [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

The Rails <=> React interop was build with reference to the [fullstackreact.com](https://www.fullstackreact.com) article titled [How to get "create-react-app" to work with your Rails API](https://www.fullstackreact.com/articles/how-to-get-create-react-app-to-work-with-your-rails-api/).
